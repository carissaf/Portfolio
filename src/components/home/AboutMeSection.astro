At the moment I’m a 3rd year undergraduate computer science student in Bina Nusantara University (or  BINUS in short) who’s majoring in Intelligent Systems. I have keen interest in data-related fields & software engineering and I’m really eager to learn more and apply my skill in these fields. </p>
